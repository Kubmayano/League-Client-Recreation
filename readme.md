Just a simple "recreation" of the League Of Legends client. Some elements are missing/changed and its because I'm not skilled enough to get it just right.
Pretty happy with how the end result turned out

Chances are resizing does NOT work well so please forgive.

I might revisit this some day and add reactive components and also implement the client more "properly" but for now its a simply CSS/HTML project
